III. DESCRIPTION

    Features:

        - aligns sequences of length 16 and up to 8192 with up to
            15 errors;
        - guarantees that alignments with at most 1 error are found
            when the length of the seeding area is >= 16 bp 
            if such an alignment exists;
        - guarantees that alignments with at most 2 errors are found
            when the length of the seeding area is >= 32 bp
            if such an alignment exists;
        - guarantees that alignments with at most k errors (2 < k < 16)
            are found when the length l of the seeding area is >=
            16*(k+1) bp if such an alignment exists;
        - can read data directly from SRA;
        - supports paired aligments;
        - if paired alignments are found for a query, then single
            alignments are not reported;
        - reports alignments with the smallest number of errors;
        - mismatches are preferred to indels;
        - supports searching alternate loci;
        - supports output in SAM format;
        - limited support for partial (non-global) alignments.

    Limitations and caveats:

        - colorspace input formats are supported by translating
            the sequence to IUPACNA format; so true colorspace
            alignments are not supported;
        - srprism is currently tested on 64-bit linux platforms.

    Important note:

        -M option limits the amount of memory SRPRISM uses for its
        internal dynamic data structures. This does not include
        memory used by the application code, libraries, local and static
        data. When running SRPRISM, it is recommended that additional
        2 GB more memory is available in the system than specified by
        -M option.

    The behavior and command line options of srprism depend on 'command' 
    parameter. The following commands are defined:

        1. mkindex      - generate srprism database from the set of 
                          sequences
        2. search       - align queries to the database
        3. help         - describes common options
           help mkindex - describes options for mkindex command
           help search  - describes options for search command

    ==================================================================
    1. Options syntax

        Command line options to srprism have the following syntax:

            --<option_name> [value]

                or

            -<short_options_name> [value]

        Not all options have the short name. Some options do not
        require a value. Such options are called flags.

        In the following sections, when describing a command line 
        option its short name is listed in brackets to the right of 
        the long option name followed by "(flag)" if the option does 
        not need an argument. For example:

            no_qids [D] (flag)

    ==================================================================
    2. Common Command Line Options

        This section describes command line options that are common 
        to all modes. 

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        input-compression (linux only)

            value type:      string
            possible values: auto none gzip bzip2
            default:         auto

            Compression type used for the input. The possible values
            are "auto", "none", "gzip", and "bzip2". If the value
            given is "auto" then the type of compression is guessed
            from the file extension. This options is not applicable
            for "sra" input format.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        log-file

            value type:      string

            If this option is not provided, then standard error is
            used as a destination for log messages.

            This options specifies the log file name.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        memory [M]

            value type:      integer
            possible values: > 0
            default:         2048

            Do not use more than this many megabytes of memory for 
            internal dynamic data structures. This number does not 
            include the footprint of the executable code, static data, 
            or stack.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        trace-level
            
            value type:      string
            possible values: info warning error quiet
            default:         warning
                
            Minimum message level to report to the log stream.

            'info'    generates a lot of (mostly statistical)
                      information about srprism progress
            'warning' reports errors (including non-critical)
            'error'   reports only critical errors
            'quiet'   nothing is reported

            The destination of the log messages is determined by
            'log-file' option. However progress information is
            always reported on the standard error.

    ==================================================================
    3. Command Line Options for 'mkindex' Mode

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        al-extend

            value type:      integer
            possible values: >= 0
            default:         2000

            Number of reference bases by which an alternate locus is
            extended to the left (right) in the case of non-fuzzy left
            (right) end.

            NOTE: If this parameter is not 0 and an alt. locus region
                  has non-fuzzy endpoints (see section IV: 
                  File Formats), then there is a possibility that
                  an alignment is extended over the boundary of the
                  region. This will lead to results with negative 
                  coordinates or alignments that seem to be 
                  partially outside of the corresponding subject
                  sequence. This is not an error, but rather a 
                  feature of SRPRISM. However some tools (e.g.
                  SAM/BAM processors) will not accept/validate
                  such results. If you do not want such results
                  to be produced by SRPRISM, please make sure that
                  the index is built with --al-extend 0 or all
                  endpoints of alternate loci are specified "fuzzy"
                  in the alternate loci specification file.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        alt-loc [a]

            value type:      string

            Name of the alternative loci specification file. See 
            section IV for the desription of the format of such 
            files.

            This command line parameter is optional. If it is not
            given, it is assumed that no alternative loci regions
            are defined.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        input [i]

            value type:      string

            Comma separated list of names of files containing the
            database sequences.

            This command line parameter is optional. It takes 
            precedence over 'input-list' option. Either 'input'
            or 'input-list' must be present on the command line.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        input-format [F]

            value type:      string
            possible values: fasta fastq cfasta cfastq
            default:         fasta

            The input format name.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        input-list [l]

            value type:      string

            Name of the file containing a list of input file names,
            one name per line.

            This command line parameter is optional and can be used
            instead of 'input' option when the list of input files is
            long. If both 'input' and 'input-list' options are 
            present, then 'input-list' is ignored.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        output [o]

            value type:      string

            Base name for generated database files.
            
            This is the required command line parameter.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        seg-letters

            value type:      integer
            possible values: positive powers of 2 between 32 and 8192
            default:         8192

            Number of letters in sequence store segment.

            It is recommended that this value is set to less than 
            half of the length of a typical sequence in the reference 
            database. Each reference sequence occupies at least one 
            segment and the sequence store can store at most 2^32 - 1 
            bases. If the reference has a large number of very short 
            sequence, decreasing this value can help to pack more 
            sequences into the sequence store and optimize memory 
            usage.

    ==================================================================
    4. Command Line Options for 'search' Mode

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        batch [b]

            value type:      integer
            possible values: > 0
            default:         10000000

            Process input in batches of at most this many queries.
            The actual number of queries in a batch may be less due
            to the lack of queries in the input.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        batch-end

            value type:      integer
            possible values: >= 0

            The number of the last batch to process.

            This command line parameter is optional.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        batch-start

            value type:      integer
            possible values: >= 0

            The number of the first batch to process.

            This command line parameter is optional.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        discover-insert (flag)

            Try to automatically discover the template length in 
            paired-end runs.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        discover-insert-and-stop (flag)

            Unconditionally stop after template lengthanalysis,
            dump the histogram and generate single results.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        discover-insert-hist-name <file-name> [default: hist.out]

            File name to dump the histogram after the template length
            analysis.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        errors [n]

            value type:      integer
            possible values: 0 - 15
            default:         5
            
            Search for alignments with at most this many errors.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        extra-tags

            value type:     string

            A string to add to each SAM entry. This should normally
            contain a set of extra tags. Format correctness is not
            verified by SRPRISM.
            This command line parameter is optional.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        index [I]

            value type:      string

            Base name for database files.

            This is a required command line parameter.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        input [i]

            value type:      string

            Specifies the source of the queries. The exact format 
            depends on the value of "--input-format" option.

            In the case of paired queries some input formats use two 
            files that are read in parallel by srprism. In this case
            the value of "--input <name>" option is interpreted as 
            follows:

                * if name is of the form "<name1>,<name2>" then name1 
                and name2 are assumed to be the files containing 
                respectively the first and the second members of the 
                pairs.

                * otherwise the single file <name> is assumed to
                contain both mates which should share the same
                id and be adjacent within the file (consequenctly
                the file in this case should contain even number
                of sequences).

            Both files have to contain the same number of sequences 
            and the ids of the corresponding sequences should be 
            identical, unless they have the structure
            <common_prefix>1 for the first mate and
            <common_prefix>2 for the second mate, where
            <common_prefix> ends in one of '.', '/', '_', in which
            case the query id is taken to be <common_prefix> without
            the last character.

            The formats that have the above restriction are "fasta", 
            "fastq", "cfasta", "cfastq".
            
            For non-paired search and formats "[c]fast[aq]", a comma
            separated list of files can be given. The files will be
            processed consequtively in the order of appearance in the
            list. Ids of reads from file with index <i> will have
            ".<i>" attached to them.

            "sam" input is different in that it always
            consists of one input file. The mate pairing in reads
            is expressed by means of the flags defined in SAM
            format itself.

            For "sra" input, a single SRA accession should be
            provided.

            This is a required command line parameter.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        input-format [F]

            value type:      string
            possible values: fasta fastq cfasta cfastq sam sra
            default:         fasta

            The input format name.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        mode [m]

            value type:         string
            possible values:    min-err, bound-err, sum-err, partial
            default value:      min-err

            min-err, bound-err, sum-err are global alignment modes;
            partial can produce non-global alignments. Each mode
            provides different ranking of the results. Only the results
            with the minimum rank (per query) are reported.

            Paired alignments are always ranked higher than single
            alignments.

            min-err:    single alignment rank is -(#errors); paired 
                        alignments are ranked first by the max of
                        ranks of the individual mate alignments,
                        and then by the sum of ranks of the individual
                        mate alignments.

            sum-err:    the same as min-err, but paired alignments
                        are ranked only by the sum of ranks of the
                        individual mate alignments.

            bound-err:  all alignments are ranked the same, but
                        alignments with fewer errors are preferred
                        when the total number of results per query
                        exceeds the value provided by --results
                        option.

            partial:    partial looks for non-global alignments
                        that include the seeding area (see options
                        --sa-start and --sa-end). The rank of an
                        individual alignment is 
                        #exact_matches - #errors. For paired 
                        alignments the rank is determined in the
                        same way as for min-err mode.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        no-qids [D] (flag)

            Do not report ids for queries. Use their ordinal number 
            instead.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        no-sids (flag)

            Do not report ids for database sequences. Use their 
            ordinal number instead.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        output [o]

            value type:      string

            File name for program output. 

            This command line parameter is optional. If not present on
            the command line, the standard output stream is used for 
            output.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        pair-distance [s]

            value type:      integer
            possible values: >= 0
            default:         500

            For paired search, the target template length in bases.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        pair-distance-fuzz [f]

            value type:      integer
            possible values: 0 - <pair-distance>
            default:         400

            Maximum acceptable fuzz (in bases) around the target 
            template length. If d is the value of 
            "--pair-distance" option and f is the value of the 
            "--pair-distance-fuzz" option than the template length
            for paired alignments must be in the interval 
            [d-f,d+f] for the pair to be reported.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        paired [p]

            value type:      string
            possible values: 'true', 'false'

            Force paired or unpaired search.
            This command line parameter is required.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        randomize <true|false> [default: false]

            Try to randomize the results of each query on subject 
            coordinate.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        random-seed <true|false> [default: false]

            Use random seed for results randomization
            (warning: results will not be reproducible).

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        repeat-threshold [R]

            value type:      integer
            possible values: >= 0
            default:         4096

            Do not use 16-mers that appear more than specified number
            of times in the database for seeding. The value of 0
            means that all 16-mers should be considered.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        result-conf [c]

            value type:      string
            possible values: illumina 454 solid 
                             <4-digit binary string>
            default:         0100

            Select which paired result configurations should be 
            reported.

            Selection is specified as a sequence of 4 digits from 
            {0,1}, where i-th digit is 1 if the i-th configuration is 
            selected.  Configurations are encoded by the second mate 
            direction and position in the result relative to the first
            mate, assuming that the first mate is matched in the 
            forward direction.

            Configurations are encoded via the following table:

                0 - the second mate is forward aligned to the right 
                    of the first mate;

                1 - the second mate is reverse aligned to the right 
                    of the first mate;

                2 - the second mate is forward aligned to the left 
                    of the first mate;

                3 - the second mate is reverse aligned to the left 
                    of the first mate.

            The following aliases are supported:

                illumina = 0100

                454      = 0100

                solid    = 0010

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        results [r]

            value type:      integer
            possible values: 1 - 255
            default:         10

            Maximum number of results to report per query.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        sa-start

            value type:      integer
            possible values: != 0
            default:         1

            Index of the first position of the seeding area.
            Negative value indicates offset from the end of the
            sequence.
            sa_start and sa_end must be of the same sign and
                abs(sa_start) should be < abs(sa_end)

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        sa-end

            value type:      integer
            possible values: != 0
            default:         8096

            Index of the last position of the seeding area.
            Negative value indicates offset from the end of the
            sequence.
            sa_start and sa_end must be of the same sign and
                abs(sa_start) should be < abs(sa_end)

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        sam-header

            value type:     string

            Name of the file to include at the beginning of
            the SAM output. It should normally contain fixed header
            lines. SRPRISM does not verify the syntax of the file.
            This command line parameter is optional.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        skip-unmapped [S]

            value type:      string
            possible values: 'true', 'false'
            default: true

            If "true", do not generate records for unmapped queries 
            in SAM output.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        threads

            value type:         integer
            possible values:    > 0
            default:            1

            Number of threads to use for search. Multi-threading is
            implemented at batch level, so setting a batch size is
            recommendeed when searching with multiple threads.

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        tmpdir [T]

            value type:      string
            default:         .

            Directory to store temporary files.

IV. FILE FORMATS

    ==================================================================
    1. Alternative Loci Specification File (ALSF)

    ALSF is a text file. Empty lines and lines started with '#' are
    considered comments and are ignored.

    Each non-comment line describes one alternative locus and 
    contains 9 text fields separated by spaces or tabs.

    field 1: alternative locus name - this field is ignored by 
                srprism;

    field 2: alternative locus id - id of the input sequence for this
                locus matching the id in the defline of that sequence
                in the srprism input;

    field 3: chromosome id - id of the reference sequence for this
                locus matching the id of the defline of that sequence
                in the srprism input;

    field 4: alternate locus sequence orientation with respect to
             the reference: '+' - same orientation; '-' - opposite
             orientation;

    field 5: chromosome start - first position of the alternate
                locus in reference coordinates;

    field 6: chromosome start is fuzzy ('y' or 'n');

    field 7: chromosome end - last position of the alternate locus
                in reference coordinates;

    field 8: chromosome end is fuzzy ('y' or 'n');

    field 9: alternate locus start: first position of the 
                alternate locus in local coordinates;

    field 10: alternate locus end: last position of the
                alternative locus in local coordinates.
                
    Currently srprism puts the following limitations on ALSF files:

        fields 9 and 10 must be equal respectively to 1 and
        the length of the alternate locus sequence;

        srprism assumes that an AL left (right) end is 'fuzzy'
        if field 6 (8) is set to 'y' and field 9 (10) is equal
        to 1 (length of the alternate locus sequence);

        If left (right) end of the alternate locus sequence
        is not 'fuzzy', then srprism extends it to the left
        (right) by the number of bases determined by the value
        of --al-extend option. The extension is done using the
        bases of the reference sequence to the left (right) of
        the alternate locus;

        field 5 must be less or equal than field 7;

        field 9 must be less or equal than field 10.

V. EXAMPLES


    Below are a few examples of srprism usage.

    1. Creating a database named srprism-db with source sequences 
    coming from file db1.fa and db2.fa. srprism is given 8 GB
    of memory to use, only serious errors are reported to a
    log file.

    srprism mkindex --trace-level error --log-file srprism.log \
        -i db1.fa,db2.fa -M 8192 -o srprism-db

    2. The same as above with the source data files listed in 
    dblist.txt with the following contents:

    ==> dblist.txt <==
    db1.fa
    db2.fa

    srprism mkindex --trace-level error --log-file srprism.log \
        -l dblist.txt -M 8192 -o srprism-db

    3. The same as above but assuming that input sequences contain
    alternative loci described in the file db.al:

    srprism mkindex --trace-level error --log-file srprism.log \
        -l dblist.txt -M 8192 -o srprism-db -a db.al

    4. Search the database srprism-db for paired hits, where 
    query pairs are in the files queries1.fastq and queries2.fastq
    in FastQ format. Look for results with at most 3 errors,
    do not restrict for repetitive seeds, report at most 20 result.
    Search for paired hits with mates are about 400 bp apart plus
    or minus 100 bp. Report the results in SAM format.

    srprism search -I srprism-db -i queries1.fastq,queries2.fastq \
        -s 400 -f 100 -n 3 -R 0 -r 20 -F fastq -M 4096 \
        -o srprism.out --paired true

    5. Same as above but search for single hits for queries from
    queries1.fastq.

    srprism search -I srprism-db -i queries1.fastq -n 3 -R 0 -r 20 \
        -F fastq -M 4096 -o srprism.out --paired false
